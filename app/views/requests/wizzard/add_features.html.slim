  User stories are short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:
  As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.

  One of the benefits of agile user stories is that they can be written at varying levels of detail. We can write a user story to cover large amounts of functionality. 
  These large user stories are generally known as epics. Here is an epic agile user story example from a desktop backup product:
 
  "As a user, I can backup my entire hard drive.
  Because an epic is generally too large for an agile team to complete in one iteration, it is split into multiple smaller user stories before it is worked on."
 
  The epic above could be split into dozens (or   
  possibly hundreds), including these two:
 
*As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified.*
*As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.*
